# Hangman

Welcome to the Chicago Architectural Buildings Hangman Game!

Before you begin you will need to open the terminal to the directory where the package.json file resides. Once in the folder you will need to run the command "initi install". This command will install all the necessary packages to use the application. 


# How to Play:
 

Get the Game Started:
-

The game will begin once you enter the command in the terminal:

- node index.js



The Basics:
-

The screen will ask you you enter your guess. 

 - If you guess right, the screen will update the underscore with the guessed letter and will send the message "Correct". 

- If you guess wrong, the screen will send you a message "Incorrect" and how many guess you have left. 

- Your guesses will only decrease if your guessed letter is wrong. 

- You will get a new word whether you guess all the letter or you guesses hit zero. 

- The game will end if there are no more words in the list.
